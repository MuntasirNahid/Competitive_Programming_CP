The longest increasing subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequenceâ€™s
elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest,
and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.
This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous or unique

For example, the longest increasing subsequence of [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15] is [0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15].[0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15] are other increasing
subsequences of equal length in the same input sequence.
