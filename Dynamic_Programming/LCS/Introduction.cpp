The longest common subsequence (LCS) is defined as the longest subsequence that
 is common to all the given sequences, provided that the elements of the subsequence
 are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.

 Almost 14 variations are available:
 ----------------------------------
 1)Longest common substring
 2)Print LCS
 3)Shortest common supersequence
 4)Print SCS
 5)Minimum Number of insertion and deletion. a->b
 6)Longest Repeating subsequence
 7)Length of longest subsequence of a which is a substring in b
 8)Subsequence pattern matching
 9)Count how many times a appear as a subsequence in b
 10)Longest palindromic subsequence
 11)Longest palindromic substring
 12)Count of the palindromic substring
 13)Minimum number of deletion in a string to make it a palindrome
 14)Minimum number of insertion in a string to make it a palindrome
